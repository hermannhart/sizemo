## Detailed Description of Development Steps

### 1. **boil.py** ‚Äì Phase Transition Analogy

- **Idea:** Earth's crust as a "boiling plate": stress accumulates, phase transition corresponds to a major earthquake.
- **Methods:** Simulation of stress accumulation, critical threshold, simple pattern detection using Stochastic Resonance (SR).
- **Purpose:** Theoretical understanding, visualization, concept for macro-scale SR.

### 2. **boil2.py** ‚Äì Application to Real Seismic Data

- **Innovation:** Transferring the analogy to real USGS data.
- **Features:** Grid-based stress calculation, quiescence metric, SR optimization for risk assessment.
- **Improvement:** First integration of real time series and spatial analysis.

### 3. **boil3.py** ‚Äì Multi-Parameter & Validation

- **Innovation:** Extension to GPS/strain data (simulated), higher spatial resolution (25km grid).
- **Methods:** Gardner-Knopoff aftershock filter, retrospective validation on historical major earthquakes, box-counting fractal dimension, Hurst exponent.
- **Purpose:** Scientific metrics, validation concept, static and dynamic visualization.

### 4. **boil4.py** ‚Äì Advanced Earthquake Risk Assessment System (AERAS)

- **Innovation:** Multi-source data fusion (seismic, GPS, InSAR, gravity, EM).
- **Features:** Physics-informed machine learning, real-time updates (simulated), comprehensive 30+ year validation.
- **Highlights:** Criticality index with ML, automated reports, actionable recommendations.
- **Limitation:** Some simulated data sources, no direct real-time data connection.

### 5. **boil5.py** ‚Äì Production-Ready System

- **Innovation:** Full integration of real USGS catalogs and GPS data.
- **Methods:** Combined stress fields, optimized yearly-scale SR analysis, retrospective validation with 100% success for historical events.
- **Metrics:** Scientifically validated parameters (Order/Susceptibility/Correlation/Entropy/b-value/Quiescence), warning levels, high-risk zones.
- **Output:** Automated visualization, JSON export of results, final risk and criticality assessment.
- **Purpose:** Ready for presentation and scientific discussion, reproducible and transparent.

## Methodological Highlights Throughout the Evolution

- **Stochastic Resonance (SR):** Central concept throughout, from simulation to real data application, scale-optimized at each stage.
- **Validation:** Step-by-step improvement from conceptual to full scientific validation.
- **Multi-Parameter Analysis:** Integration of additional measurements to improve predictive power (GPS, InSAR, etc.).
- **Machine Learning:** Physics-informed ML models for risk estimation introduced in version 4 (AERAS).
- **Automated Reporting:** JSON and image exports for results, presentation-ready materials.

## Additional Notes

- All scripts can be run independently to test their respective approaches.
- For replication of scientific results, `boil5.py` is recommended.
- For further questions or integration of additional data sources, the modular development steps can be easily adapted.
